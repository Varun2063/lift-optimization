Flow to run the project:

1. Run the Experiment_no_model.py to create a simulation and 
   to calculate how much time it takes to complete the lift stops when no model is passed.

2. Run the Experiment_model.py to create a simulation and 
   to calculate how much time it takes to complete the lift stops with a model that assists the lift in which floors to stop and which not to.

"main_streams/" has the video that we are using as the videos in each floor.

model.py contanis the detection model.
